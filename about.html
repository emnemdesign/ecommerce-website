	<h1>What is Origami?</h1>
	<p>Origami is an art of paper folding to create recognizable structures. The precise origin is unknown. The word origami derives from the Japanese word Ori meaning fold and kami meaning paper. These two words combined formed are pronounced Origami. For centuries the instructions for this craft circulated from word of mouth. One of the oldest known documents written of Japanese origami surfaced in 1797 called How to Fold 1000 Cranes. The Japanese believed that you can grant one wish if you folded 1000 cranes.
	Master Yoshizawa Akira was responsible for the commencing of original modern origami in 1950. Paper was very scarce in Japan, but many countries around Japan had it available. It's long history in Japan later became a childhood past time in countries like Germany and the United Kingdom.</p>
